the testimonials section contains feedback from people i've worked with: my sber curator, my university professor and my curator from the times i worked at the tretyakov gallery (moscow). the section is built using the scroller module, and to see through each testimonial you can just drag the cards from side to side.

the contact section is divided into 2 parts: on the left there are links to directly access me through messengers or your own email, on the right there's a mail form which totally works two (its external module as well)
